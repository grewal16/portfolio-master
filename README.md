*   **HTML5:** For semantic structure and content organization. (`index.html`, `new.html`, `sanika.html`)
*   **CSS3:** For modern styling, animations, and responsive design. (`assets/css/style.css`)
*   **JavaScript:** For interactive elements, dynamic content, and enhanced user experience. (`assets/js/script.js`)

There are no server-side components or databases involved, making **Portfolio Master** incredibly lightweight and fast.

## ðŸ“Š Architecture & Database Schema
Given that **Portfolio Master** is a static, front-end only website, there is no traditional backend architecture or database schema. The flow focuses entirely on client-side interaction and the delivery of static assets.

This diagram illustrates the simplicity and directness of a static website. User requests are handled directly by a web server, which serves pre-built files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images) to the user's browser for rendering and interaction.
